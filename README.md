# TOOLS-IN-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT-2

# This project aims to develop a Python-based automated data analysis and visualization script, autolysis.py, capable of working with any CSV dataset. The script leverages GPT-4o-Mini for dynamic insights, analysis, and storytelling.

# The primary goals are:

To perform robust statistical analysis, uncover correlations, detect anomalies, and identify patterns in datasets.

To generate meaningful data visualizations supporting the analysis.

To narrate a coherent, insightful story summarizing the findings and their implications.

The script achieves these by:

# Accepting a CSV file as input.

Conducting generic analysis and summarizing key features of the dataset.

Using GPT-4o-Mini for dynamic prompts to extract additional insights and craft the narrative.

Creating a README.md file and PNG visualizations as outputs.
